Authors note.
Good news - this source code has been updated. It was originally published in 1996, pre-standard, and needed just a few nips and tucks to work properly in today's world. These new versions of the code should be pretty portable - the build properly with g++ 3.x, 4.x and Visual C++ 2003.

stree2006.cpp
    A simple program that builds a suffix tree from an input string.
streed2006.cpp
    The same program with much debugging code added.
